# laravel auto formation chapitre :  validate data 

 - When the user interacts with a form, it is important to ensure that the data they enter corresponds to what is expected.
 
- Let's use a validator class in Laravel

- The make() method takes two parameters. The first parameter is an associative array containing the data, where each key represents the name of a property. The second parameter is also an associative array, where each key corresponds to the property name we want to validate, and it contains the validation rules for that property
